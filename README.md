-------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the code for the drone. The code runs on the zephyr RTOS and uses the NordicSemi Peripheral UART as the base code base.

the IMU sensor used is the CEVA FSM300. Currently this is the only external Peripheral used.

The connection diagram is as follows:
